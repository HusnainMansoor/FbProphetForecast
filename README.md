Importing Libraries:
Several libraries are imported:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
yfinance to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Prophet for forecasting time series data.
os to handle file system operations.
Defining Stock Tickers:
A list of 50 stock tickers from various sectors is defined. This list includes companies like META, TSLA, GOOG, VZ, and many others.

Setting Date Range:
The date range for the historical stock data is set from January 1, 2018, to the current date.

Fetching Historical Data:
The historical adjusted closing prices for the defined stock tickers are downloaded using the yfinance library. This data includes the adjusted closing prices for each stock over the specified date range.

Calculating Monthly Returns:
Monthly returns are calculated by resampling the historical stock data to the last day of each month and then computing the percentage change from one month to the next. The resulting data includes the monthly returns for each stock.

Forecasting Monthly Returns:
For each stock ticker:

The monthly returns data is prepared by resetting the index and renaming columns to be compatible with the Prophet model.
The Prophet model is used to fit the historical monthly returns data and then forecast the future returns for the next 12 months.
The forecasted data is collected and stored for each stock.
Combining Forecasted Returns:
All the individual forecasted returns for each stock are combined into a single DataFrame. This DataFrame includes the forecasted monthly returns for all the stocks.

Saving the Forecasted Returns:
The combined DataFrame of forecasted monthly returns is saved as a CSV file in a specified directory on the file system. The code ensures that the directory exists and creates it if necessary before saving the file.

Outcome
The process results in a CSV file containing the forecasted monthly returns for the next 12 months for each of the 50 stocks. This file can be used for further analysis, investment decisions, or other financial planning activities. The CSV file is saved in the specified directory with a given filename, providing a structured and easily accessible format for the forecasted data.
